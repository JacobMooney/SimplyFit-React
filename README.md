# Simply Fit - Fitness for anyone

Simply Fit is a react project I made during the NuCamp coding bootcamp. My primary goal during this project was getting used to React and handling the state. This site uses React, React Router, BootStrap / ReactStrap.

I am passionate about fitness which is what inspired this idea, and eventually in the future I would like to make a more robust version of this site/app.
