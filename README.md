# Simply Fit - Fitness for anyone

Simply Fit is a react project I made during the NuCamp coding bootcamp. My primary goal during this project was getting used to React and handling the state. This site uses React, React Router, BootStrap / ReactStrap.

I am passionate about fitness which is what inspired this idea, and eventually in the future I would like to make a more robust version of this site/app. While many of the concepts could use a deeper dive, if you're curious about fitness or getting in shape I did put a decent amount of beginner information about each topic in the site.

## About the routine builder
The routine builder is a tool that takes in user selections and returns a routine determined by; number of days per week, fitness goal type, and potentially included time for cardio and stretching.
